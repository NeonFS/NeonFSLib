# NeonFSLib Documentation

> **Note:** this documentation currently focuses on **internal modules** and implementation details.
> Public APIs and user-facing guids will be added once the external endpoints are finalized

---

## Documentation Structure

- `internal/` ─ Internal implementation docs, design notes and usage patterns for maintainers and contributors.
- `public/` ─ _(coming soon)_ Public API reference and high-level usage guides for developers using the library.

---

## Current Coverage

### Internal Modules

-[internal/core/Result.md](internal/core/Result.md)
Explanation of the `neonfs::Result` class and error handling model.

---

## Status

NeonFSLib is still in the **core infrastructure* phase*. Internal features are being built with performance and maintainability in mind.
Once the public-facing APIs are stable, a proper user guid will be added under `public/`.

Stay tuned!
